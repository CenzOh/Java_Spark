# Project 1 Lecture 6
Refer to the outter most read me for a setup. When starting lecture 6, Project 1 should be opened/created in Eclipse

### HOW TO READ THE FILES
`src/main/java/com.jobreadyprogrammer.spark` includes our java files<br>
`ApplicationBase.java` unedited given completed code file, I renamed it though because ir was originally called Application.java<br>
`Application.java` my hand written code version. I like taking notes in code but its hard to read. SO i have two files, one with comments (this) and one w/o (base file)<br>
`src/main/resources/name_and_comments.txt` text file we read as input within the example.<br>
